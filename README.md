## Installation

In this section I will describe the installation process and the environment setup needed to run the application locally. However, one must have node installed in the machine in order to follow the steps below.

The code base can be cloned either by downloading as zip from github or using the following command-

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zulkarnine1/Assignment1.git
```

Then the dependencies can be installed using the following command-

```sh
npm i
```

After the dependencies are install a ".env" file needs to be created the following environment variables are to be added in the file-

```sh
MONGO_KEY=
```
- The MONGO_KEY should be the link to the database with the auth credentials added in it.


Finally, the application can be run by going to the root directory in terminal and executing the following command:

```sh
node app.js
```
